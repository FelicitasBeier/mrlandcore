#' @description This function uses total physical area and
#'              crop-specific harvested area data from LandInG
#'              to calculate crop-specific physical and harvested
#'              areas considering special rules
#'              for the allocation of perennial and annual crops.
#'
#' @param sectoral    "kcr" MAgPIE items, and "lpj" LPJmL items
#' @param physical    if TRUE the sum over all crops plus fallow land (of calcFallowLand)
#'                    agrees with the physical cropland of readLandInG(subtype = physical)
#' @param cellular    if TRUE: calculates cellular crop area for all magpie croptypes.
#'                    Option FALSE is not (yet) available.
#' @param irrigation  If true: cellular areas are returned separated
#'                    into irrigated and rainfed
#' @param selectyears extract certain years from the data
#' @param lpjml       LPJmL version used to determine multiple cropping suitability
#' @param climatetype Climate scenario or historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"
