\arguments{
\item{sectoral}{"kcr" MAgPIE items, and "lpj" LPJmL items}

\item{physical}{if TRUE the sum over all crops plus fallow land (of calcFallowLand)
agrees with the physical cropland of readLandInG(subtype = physical)}

\item{cellular}{if TRUE: calculates cellular crop area for all magpie croptypes.
Option FALSE is not (yet) available.}

\item{cells}{Switch between "magpiecell" (59199) and "lpjcell" (67420)}

\item{irrigation}{If true: cellular areas are returned separated
into irrigated and rainfed}

\item{selectyears}{extract certain years from the data}

\item{lpjml}{LPJmL version used to determine multiple cropping suitability}

\item{climatetype}{Climate scenario or historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"
used to determine multiple cropping suitability}

MAgPIE object with cropareas

\description{
This function uses total physical area and
             crop-specific harvested area data from LandInG
             to calculate crop-specific physical and harvested
             areas considering special rules
             for the allocation of perennial and annual crops.
