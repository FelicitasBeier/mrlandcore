}
\arguments{
\item{selectyears}{Years to be returned}

\item{lpjml}{LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop}

historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"}

\item{suitability}{"endogenous": suitability for multiple cropping determined
             by rules based on grass and crop productivity
"exogenous": suitability for multiple cropping given by
             GAEZ data set}

\item{sectoral}{"kcr" MAgPIE crops, and "lpj" LPJmL crops}

\description{
Calculates which grid cells are potentially suitable for
             multiple cropping activities under rainfed and irrigated conditions.
             Calculation is based on the length of the growing period determined by
             monthly grassland gross primary production (GPP).
