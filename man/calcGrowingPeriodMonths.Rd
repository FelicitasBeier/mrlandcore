\usage{
calcGrowingPeriodMonths(selectyears, lpjml, climatetype, minThreshold = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{selectyears}{Years to be returned}

\item{lpjml}{LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop}

\item{climatetype}{Switch between different climate scenarios or
historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"}

\item{minThreshold}{Threshold of monthly grass GPP to be classified as
growing period month
Unit of the threshold is gC/m^2.
Default: 100gC/m^2
Note: the default value is chosen based on LPJmL version 5
      to reflect multiple cropping suitability as shown in GAEZ-4.
      An update of LPJmL5 with regards to grass management may
      require an adjustment of the threshold.}
